Welcome to my blog!

I am Gourav Singh Bajeli, Final year UG at Amrita School of Engineering.

I have been an integral part of [bi0s](https://ctftime.org/team/662) since 2019, actively contributing to the team's remarkable success. As an avid participant in Capture The Flag competitions, I constantly push myself to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest developments in the cybersecurity field. My areas of expertise revolve around reverse engineering and vulnerability research, allowing me to effectively identify and address security vulnerabilities in various systems.

In addition to my technical proficiency, I possess strong teaching skills, particularly in the areas of binary exploitation and reverse engineering. I have had the opportunity to conduct training sessions for freshman students, imparting my knowledge and helping them gain a solid foundation in these subjects.

During my internship as an N-day Research Advocate at Exodus Intelligence, I had the privilege of working closely with cutting-edge vulnerabilities. I honed my skills in producing comprehensive technical documentation and developing exploits for vulnerabilities that had recently been patched. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of the complexities and intricacies of the cybersecurity landscape.

Overall, my involvement with [bi0s](https://ctftime.org/team/662), active participation in Capture The Flag competitions, expertise in reverse engineering and vulnerability research, and experience as an N-day Research Advocate have all contributed to my well-rounded skill set and passion for tackling cybersecurity challenges.

As a current undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering (AIE), I have gained significant expertise in deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) for image and text processing tasks. 

My GitHub repository is a rich collection of projects that cover a wide range of artificial intelligence topics, including machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and other relevant areas. It also includes projects related to cyber-security, specifically focusing on critical aspects like fuzzing and reverse engineering.
